    Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.

## The problem and objective

Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.

According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.

The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase.

On the other hand, at the dawn of the industrial revolution, the Earth’s atmosphere contained 278 parts of CO₂ per million. Today, after more than two and a half centuries of fossil fuel use, that figure is around 414 parts per million (ppm). If the build-up of CO₂ continues at current rates, by 2060 it will have passed 560 ppm – more than double the level of pre-industrial times.

Exactly how the climate will respond to all this extra CO₂ is one of the central questions in climate science. 

> The aim of this project is to make predictions of the evolution of temperature and CO2 emissions through **Time Series Analysis using *Prophet* python library**.



## What is Time Series Analysis?

A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.

In Time Series, we have only 2 variables, time & the variable we want to forecast. E.g. height of ocean tides, count of sunspots, regular changing of seasons every year, glowing of rice light, motion of pendulum in vacuum. Etc. etc. any event occurring at equal interval and contains time as a variable.

### **Time Series Components**



- **Autocorrelation**

    Autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.

- **Seasonality**

    Seasonality is a repeating pattern within a fixed period. Refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or high temperatures in summer and lower in winter.

- **Stationarity**

    Stationarity is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.
